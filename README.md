CLI Expense Tracker

This is a simple CLI-based Expense Tracker. It's straightforward and easy to use. You can add expenses, view them in different ways, edit or delete entries, set budgets, and generate summary reports — all from your terminal.

Feel free to explore and “mess around” with this tracker.

My Journey With This Project

This is the first real Python project I completed start-to-finish by myself. (Maybe a little help from ChatGPT, but honestly, I didn’t cheat!)

Before starting this project, I was anxious and doubted myself. I thought I wasn’t ready. But it turns out, it wasn’t as hard as I expected. Honestly, looking back, I could have done this project weeks ago if I hadn’t doubted myself. The first lesson this project taught me: just go for it instead of questioning your readiness.

While building this project, I realized a lot:

String formatting: Before, I hated formatting strings. It felt tedious and confusing. But doing it with focus and understanding, it’s really not that hard.

Why OOP exists: Initially, I thought, “Why do I need OOP? I can just write functions.” But while writing reusable code, I kept thinking, “Isn’t there a way to reuse this code cleanly?” And then it clicked — that’s OOP. I learned it the hard way. The V2 of this project will be a clean, object-oriented version with more advanced features.

This project might not have a flashy frontend or be perfect, and there might be some small bugs. But it’s honest work, and I’m proud of it.

Usage

Clone the repository:

git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-folder>


Run the program:

python main.py


Replace main.py with the filename of your main script if different.

Follow the CLI prompts to:

Add new expenses

View all expenses

View expenses by category or date
